About:
ALPHA: password managing software to help store
informarion and make lives easier. We might look
and seem profesional, but I can assure you this
franchize is just regular people. We just want
to live our lives, and make others easier.
So if we seem idiotic you know why. This current
release was for a programing class that Skyler
Wisdom and my self were tasked on creating I
ended up doing the whole thing and not realy
letting him do the work. even though he did not
code any of this software he helped present, and
do everything else required while I did this.

The idea came when I was put in front of the
class and had to give a poposition for a program
that I would have to make and pitch to investers
(other teachers). I wasn't to sure what to say so
I thought of something that I could do and made a
joke out of it. I heard someone in the class say
"WAT" before I got up to the front of class and
came up with Password WaT. After the class of
10-15 students had to vote between eachothers
ideas and I guess I made my little speach about it
was funny enough to were I got the top 4 and
My program was going to be a reality. When in
honesty I wanted nothing more than to just play
on my phone some more that class.

As implied Skyler was my partner on the project and
he tried to help, but we didn't know how to do this
and not step on eachothers backs throughout the
process so I just had him look stuff up once in a
while. He was mostly just on his phone chilling
with me, or making the powerpoints, and writeups
for us. Our 3rd member dropped the class I truly
have no clue who he was, but the other 4 groups
all had 3 - 4 members while me and Skyler were it.
I had to and still have to at the time of writing
this have leave the school year early and go to
the East Cost to visit family so I told Skyler I
Would get this done and I did. Now here we are and
I decided that I want to distribute the software
and update it. I will proboably just have it be a
private utility for now, and release it to the public
when it is in Beta, not a 72 hour later school project.
